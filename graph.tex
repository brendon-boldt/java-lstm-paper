% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2013,epsf,natbib]{article}

%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
\usepackage{subfigure} 

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

\usepackage{scrextend}
\usepackage{tikz,pgfplots}

% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2013} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2013} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the
% note in the first column to ``Proceedings of the...''
% \usepackage[accepted]{icml2013}
